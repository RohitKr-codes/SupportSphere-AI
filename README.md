# 🌟 SupportSphere AI

An intelligent, persona-aware AI customer support system powered by **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, **Gemini LLM**, **ChromaDB vector search**, and **Streamlit UI**, designed to simulate real-world enterprise support automation.

---

##  Key Features

### Persona-Aware Intelligence
Automatically detects user intent and adapts responses for:
- Technical Experts (detailed debugging & logs)
- Frustrated Users (empathetic support)
- Business Executives (concise impact-focused answers)

---

### RAG-Based Knowledge Engine
- Uses **ChromaDB vector database**
- Embeds documents using **Sentence Transformers**
- Retrieves most relevant context before generating answers

---

### 🤖 LLM Integration (Gemini AI)
- Generates human-like responses using Google Gemini
- Context-aware prompt engineering
- Safe fallback handling when API limits are reached

---

### ⚠️ Smart Escalation System
Automatically escalates cases when:
- Sensitive keywords are detected
- Low retrieval confidence
- No relevant knowledge found

---

### Conversation Memory
Maintains session-based chat history for contextual continuity.

---

### Analytics & Feedback
- Stores user interactions in SQLite database
- Tracks escalation patterns
- Supports feedback logging
